# Image-Classification-Using-TensorFlow

This Project creates an image classifier using a keras.Sequential model on a dataset of morethan 25k images of size 150x150 distributed under 6 categories.
Building,Forest,Sea,Street,Glacier,Mountain

This will follow a basic machine learning workflow:

Examine and understand data
Build an input pipeline
Build the model
Train the model
Test the model
Improve the model and repeat the process
