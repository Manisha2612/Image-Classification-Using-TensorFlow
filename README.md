# Image-Classification-Using-TensorFlow

This Project creates an image classifier using a keras.Sequential model on a dataset of morethan 3500 flower pictures.
This will follow a basic machine learning workflow:

Examine and understand data
Build an input pipeline
Build the model
Train the model
Test the model
Improve the model and repeat the process


Implemented Keras TensorFlow Package for Intel Image Classification for Image Scene Classification of Multiclass
